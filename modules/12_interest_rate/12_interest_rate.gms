*' @title Interest rate

*' @description Interest rates are used in MAgPIE as a risk-accounting 
*' factor associated with investment activities [@wang_taking_2016].
*' Interest rates are required for inter-temporal calculations in the model
*' such as shifting investment from one time step to another or distribution of
*' one-time investments over several time steps (e.g. in the modules 
*' [13_tc], [39_landconversion] and [41_area_equipped_for_irrigation]).
