*' @description In the static realization, pasture areas are constant over time,
*' independent from developments in the livestock sector and land competition.

*' @limitations There are no computational limitations to this realization.
*' Since pasture areas are static, they do not respond to demand trajectories
*' and trends in the land use and agricultural sectors like intensification
*' pathways, increasing production of animal products, bioenergy production or
*' afforestation policies. This may lead to an inconsistent overall picture of
*' future land use dynamics.
