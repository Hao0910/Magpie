*' @description In the endo_jun13 realization, pasture area and related carbon
*' stocks are modelled endogenously. The initial spatially explicit patterns of
*' pasture are defined in the module [10_land] by the land use input data set.
*' For future time steps, pasture area depends on the demand for biomass from
*' pastures to feed livestock as calculated in the module [70_livestock] and
*' from the intensity of pasture utilization ("pasture yield") as determined in
*' the module [14_yields].

*' @limitations No consideration of generic differences between extensive and
*' intensive grazing systems, of explicit pasture management options and of
*' related degradation of pastures.
