*' @description This realization allows the model to endogenously decide on investments to deploy additional
*' irrigation infrastructure, i.e. to increase the area equipped for irrigation (AEI). Initial values for AEI
*' in 1995 are taken from @siebert_FAO_2007. Contraction of AEI is not possible.
*' Irrigated crop production can only take place where irrigation infrastructure is present.
*'
*' Unit costs per hectare for AEI expansion are derived from a World Bank study (@worldbank_irrigation_1995)
*' and adjusted for the regions used in MAgPIE. The region mapping is as follows:
*'
*' ![Mapping between MAgPIE regions and the regions in 
*' [@worldbank_irrigation_1995]](regions.png){ width=60% }
*'
*' The regional unit costs converge linearly towards the European level until 2050.
