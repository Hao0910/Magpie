*' @title Phosphorus
*'
*' @description The phosphorus module is introduced to estimate the major
*' P-flows in the agricultural sector and to determine the dynamics of P-Pools in the soil.
*' Different P-flows can be accounted in MAgPIE, among others:
*'
*'     * P withdrawals by harvest: estimated as P content of crop harvest
*'     * P withdrawals by harvest of above ground residues: estimated as P content of residues
*'     * P inputs by decaying recycled residues: estimated as P content of recycled residues
*'     * P inputs by burned residues: estimated as P content of burned residues but no combustion losses assumed
*'     * P inputs by manure recycled to croplands
*'     * P inputs by fertilizers
*'     * P inputs by release of plant-available P from the permanent P-Pool.
*'     * P inputs by seed
*'     * P inputs by weathering
*'     * P losses by erosion
*'     * P losses by leaching
*'
*' However, for the time being, this module is not activated in MAgPIE.
*' It is a topic we seek to include in future developments of the model as enriches
*' the biophysical aspects of the model as well as adds to the fertilizer costs (and hence total costs of production).
